# IoMT-AI-Anomaly-Detection-Review-Paper-Individual-Assignment

## üìò Overview

This repository contains my submission for the **3rd Year, 1st Semester** Individual Assignment for the **AIA** module at SLIIT. The project focuses on reviewing the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in anomaly detection within the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) networks.

## üß© Project Structure

The repository includes the following files:

* `Review Paper.pdf`: A comprehensive review paper detailing the various AI-based anomaly detection methods applied to IoMT networks, including their advantages, limitations, and potential future directions.
* `Presentation IT22083678.pptx`: A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the key findings and insights from the review paper.

## üîê About IoMT and Anomaly Detection

The **Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)** refers to the network of connected medical devices that collect, transmit, and analyze health data. While IoMT offers numerous benefits in healthcare, it also introduces security challenges, particularly concerning unauthorized access and data breaches.

**Anomaly detection** plays a crucial role in identifying unusual patterns or behaviors within IoMT networks that may indicate potential security threats. AI techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, have been increasingly utilized to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of anomaly detection systems in these networks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Techniques Used

In the review, various AI-based anomaly detection methods were examined, including:

* **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Techniques like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.
* **Deep Learning Models**: Neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
* **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple models to improve detection performance.
* **Unsupervised Learning**: Methods that do not require labeled data for training.

## üìÑ Documentation

The `Review Paper.pdf` provides an in-depth analysis of:

* **AI Techniques in Anomaly Detection**: Overview of various AI methods applied to anomaly detection in IoMT networks.
* **Challenges and Limitations**: Discussion on the challenges faced in implementing AI-based anomaly detection systems.
* **Future Directions**: Insights into potential future research areas and advancements in the field.

The `Presentation IT22083678.pptx` offers a concise summary of the review paper, highlighting the key points and findings.
